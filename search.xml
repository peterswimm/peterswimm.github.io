        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/492-snowkiss-square.jpg" alt="Product Art"></p><p>I had the chance to create a demo track for the fantastic new sampled instrument <a href="https://shop.karoryfer.com/snowkiss-guitar">Snowkiss Guitar</a>. I’ll let the website explain it:</p><blockquote><p>A very indie virtual guitar - a boutique offset-body style, and with the sounds you’ll need for making weird noisy music all included. After sampling a few cheap guitars, we went for a really nice one. This Momose MJM has the traditional bridge and tailpiece, and Mojotone pickups modeled after pickups from above-average 1959 Fender Jazzmasters. It also looks really nice, with the snowflake and cherry petal inlays, the figured cherry top, and the white burst finish.</p></blockquote><p>Over a quick coffee break, I hooked up an instance of the plug through a midi arpeggiator, and ran it through Native Instrument’s Guitar Rig 5. Super fun and quick results! You can view the demo here:</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wtQ6FHzx91Y" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>The plugin is available now with an intro price of $19 until September 30th, 2020. Regular price: $39. You can get it at the <a href="https://shop.karoryfer.com/snowkiss-guitar">Karoryfer Store</a></p><p>I want to do more demos!</p>]]></content>

Almost everyone there has either built a bot, or really wants to build a bot. We are very lucky to have many friendly and successful developers volunteer their time to share their knowledge and work with all kinds of users.</p><p>When you have a no barriers entryway into a complex concept like bot development, making an onboarding resource that works for newcomers and experts alike can seem daunting. <strong>Assume too much, and you can easily confuse and overwhelm. Too little, and you lead to boredom and uselessness.</strong> To create a great baseline experience in our community, we created <strong>Welcomebot</strong>.</p><p><strong>Welcomebot was designed to be a concierge to new users joining our slack community.</strong> Through it we hope to cut down on the uncertainty of where to ask your getting started questions, illuminate which channels to look for examples and existing tools, and in general make the onboarding experiencing informative and easy for the entire spectrum of users.</p><p><img src="https://peterswimm.com/images/medium/1_rrHSxXm6l97iesiJJTCegg.png" alt=""></p><p>Built using our new <a href="https://studio.botkit.ai">**Botkit Studio</a>** tool, we will be able to quickly respond to necessary content updates, user experience tweaks and fixes, and adding cool new features to the bot. For me, a non-native coder, having access to a visual CMS for scripting the bots word was great experience, and quickly proved to be a powerful tool in designing targeted information via the constraints of Slack chat formatting.</p><p>Welcomebot main functions are the following:</p><ul><li><p>When a user joins, it sends them a DM.</p></li><li><p>It responds to things like ‘help’ and ‘get started’ and gives suggestions about channels and resources.</p></li><li><p>It informs people about the code of conduct and the rules.</p></li></ul><p>If you want to build a bot like this for your team, <a href="https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/botkit-is-better-with-slacks-events-api-f9a27e051591#.q58s6b1t6">a great starting point is this blog post</a> by my colleague <a href="undefined">Eric Soelzer</a>.</p><p>Using the tools you make, and seeing real-time usage and reaction from your community is an intensely satisfying process, and will continue to be an important part of our internal design processes going forward.</p><p><strong>Are you interested in taking Studio for a test drive</strong>? <a href="https://howdyai.typeform.com/to/JNTm22">Sign up here </a>to be added to our developer preview or to be notified when the tool is available to the public!</p><p><em><a href="https://botkit.ai">Botkit</a> is the leading open source tool for developing bots for Slack, Facebook and other major messaging platforms. <a href="https://github.com/howdyai">Dive into our extensive documentation, examples and starter projects</a>, then <a href="http://dev4slack.xoxco.com/">join 3500 other bot developers</a> in our community chat room.</em></p>]]></content>

He is one of our featured speakers at next month’s <a href="https://talkabot.ai/">Talkabot Conference</a>, and took some time to discuss with us the emerging bot landscape and opportunities for brands in messaging:*</p><h3 id="How-did-you-first-become-aware-of-the-potential-of-chat-bots-in-the-mobile-messaging-space"><a href="#How-did-you-first-become-aware-of-the-potential-of-chat-bots-in-the-mobile-messaging-space" class="headerlink" title="How did you first become aware of the potential of chat bots in the mobile messaging space?"></a><strong><em>How did you first become aware of the potential of chat bots in the mobile messaging space?</em></strong></h3><p>I had seen bots on WeChat a few years ago — thought they were interesting but didn’t really dig in. When I joined Snaps, <a href="http://vivianrosenthal.com/">the founder</a> and I had a lot of conviction that the messaging space was going to be the next big space for brands, so we launched a content platform for brands to engage in messaging and stayed close to developments in the space from then on.</p><p>There were two events in 2015 that got us more interested specifically in bots. The first was our initial activations on <a href="https://bots.kik.com">Kik</a>. With Burger King, we brought one of the first brand ChatBots to the platform. We saw phenomenal results. Read rates, response rates, share rates were all incredible.</p><p>The second event was an early meeting with <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2016/04/12/bots-for-messenger/">Facebook</a>, where we had a long conversation with a few folks on their team about bots, what we had learned to date, etc. We had pretty strong conviction by the middle of last year that bots were going to roll out in a bigger way to the US market in 2016, and that we should be building into that future.</p><h3 id="What-opportunities-do-you-see-for-brands-as-messaging-applications-race-to-add-rich-experiences-like-bots-to-their-platforms"><a href="#What-opportunities-do-you-see-for-brands-as-messaging-applications-race-to-add-rich-experiences-like-bots-to-their-platforms" class="headerlink" title="What opportunities do you see for brands as messaging applications race to add rich experiences like bots to their platforms?"></a><strong><em>What opportunities do you see for brands as messaging applications race to add rich experiences like bots to their platforms?</em></strong></h3><p>When we look a the messaging space from a brand lens, we think about their opportunity in two buckets.The first bucket is around capitalizing on the use of rich media in messaging apps for branding opportunities. We’ve driven well over 100 million shares of branded content in messaging apps through our products focused on emoji, stickers, GIFs and videos. It’s been a huge win for our brand partners looking tell stories and spread word-of-mouth marketing in the space.</p><p>The second bucket is conversational UI, and we’ve built a logic engine and do relatively complex server integrations to help brands deploy bots in places like Facebook Messenger, Kik and Skype. We see bots as an avenue to entertain, to inform, to personalize and to maintain relationships with customers.</p><h3 id="What-the-the-challenges-that-face-brands-as-they-deal-more-individually-with-potential-users-across-these-platforms"><a href="#What-the-the-challenges-that-face-brands-as-they-deal-more-individually-with-potential-users-across-these-platforms" class="headerlink" title="What the the challenges that face brands as they deal more individually with potential users across these platforms?"></a><strong><em>What the the challenges that face brands as they deal more individually with potential users across these platforms?</em></strong></h3><p>It depends on the brand’s strategy. I would submit that brands looking to <em>replace</em> (vs. augment)* *components of their customer service operations with bot automation are going to find all sorts of challenges. But the biggest challenge right now for brands and bots are executing experiences that consumers actually want to engage with at scale. I think this is as much a creative endeavor as a technical one.</p><h3 id="Have-you-ever-been-surprised-about-something-you-discovered-from-a-mobile-messaging-interaction"><a href="#Have-you-ever-been-surprised-about-something-you-discovered-from-a-mobile-messaging-interaction" class="headerlink" title="Have you ever been surprised about something you discovered from a mobile messaging interaction?"></a><strong><em>Have you ever been surprised about something you discovered from a mobile messaging interaction?</em></strong></h3><p>I’m always pleasantly surprised when brands put humans on the other side of a branded conversation. Scale is obviously difficult, but I love texting with businesses and I’d like to do more of it.</p><h3 id="If-there-was-one-thing-you-could-ask-a-bot-to-do-for-you-that-can’t-be-done-today-what-would-it-be"><a href="#If-there-was-one-thing-you-could-ask-a-bot-to-do-for-you-that-can’t-be-done-today-what-would-it-be" class="headerlink" title="If there was one thing you could ask a bot to do for you that can’t be done today, what would it be?"></a><strong><em>If there was one thing you could ask a bot to do for you that can’t be done today, what would it be?</em></strong></h3><p>Put my kids to bed.</p><p><em>Join us Sept 28–29th in Austin, Texas to discuss bots, conversational software and community for the first ever <a href="https://talkabot.ai/">Talkabot Conference</a>.

I think the best feedback we’ve gotten is from users who were right in our target audience. The biggest fans were mainly women, who indeed experience online or messaging harassment in the dating scene. They have actually found it pretty useful to not have to deal with the can’t-win situations they can find themselves in while communicating with somewhat irrational dates.</p><p>Even for women we’ve talked to who are off the market, the resounding feedback we heard about both Ghostbot and Burner is, “I wish I had that when I was dating!”</p><p>There has been some negative response, though.</p><blockquote><h1 id="Some-folks-were-uncomfortable-with-perpetuating-what-they-thought-to-be-the-emotionally-immature-practice-of-ghosting-a-person-and-creating-technology-to-facilitate-it-Only-male-users-were-actually-voicing-that-concern-after-we-released-it"><a href="#Some-folks-were-uncomfortable-with-perpetuating-what-they-thought-to-be-the-emotionally-immature-practice-of-ghosting-a-person-and-creating-technology-to-facilitate-it-Only-male-users-were-actually-voicing-that-concern-after-we-released-it" class="headerlink" title="Some folks were uncomfortable with perpetuating what they thought to be the emotionally immature practice of ghosting a person, and creating technology to facilitate it. Only male users were actually voicing that concern after we released it."></a>Some folks were uncomfortable with perpetuating what they thought to be the emotionally immature practice of ghosting a person, and creating technology to facilitate it. Only male users were actually voicing that concern after we released it.</h1></blockquote><p>Those were concerns we had going into the project, but when we examined the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/byefelipe/?hl=en">hostile climate women face in dating</a>, we knew the emotional maturity discussion went beyond ghosting.</p><h3 id="What-were-some-of-the-unforeseen-challenges-you-ran-into-once-Ghostbot-was-live-in-the-world"><a href="#What-were-some-of-the-unforeseen-challenges-you-ran-into-once-Ghostbot-was-live-in-the-world" class="headerlink" title="What were some of the unforeseen challenges you ran into once Ghostbot was live in the world?"></a><strong>What were some of the unforeseen challenges you ran into once Ghostbot was live in the world?</strong></h3><p>The biggest challenge was just letting the bot do it’s thing, and not constantly watching it and trying to train everything that confused the NLP. But, we decided to take a step back and let Ghostbot do Ghostbot for a bit before we started training it a ton. It was a nice break. Other than the continued training, we had no big hurdles. There are a couple of bugs that come up here and there.</p><h3 id="Ghostbot-has-been-called-“a-personal-firewall”-how-important-do-you-think-NLP-driven-Bots-will-become-to-protect-people-as-society-becomes-increasingly-connected-via-social-networks"><a href="#Ghostbot-has-been-called-“a-personal-firewall”-how-important-do-you-think-NLP-driven-Bots-will-become-to-protect-people-as-society-becomes-increasingly-connected-via-social-networks" class="headerlink" title="Ghostbot has been called “a personal firewall”, how important do you think NLP driven Bots will become to protect people as society becomes increasingly connected via social networks?"></a><strong>Ghostbot has been called “a personal firewall”, how important do you think NLP driven Bots will become to protect people as society becomes increasingly connected via social networks?</strong></h3><p>This will become massive the more that we connect the intimate details of our lives to social networks. Social networks have basically exploited our personal data in order to sell that data to big brands so those brands can sell us more things.</p><blockquote><h1 id="I-know-there-are-a-lot-of-folks-who-lament-that-the-best-minds-of-our-generation-are-just-inventing-new-ways-to-advertise"><a href="#I-know-there-are-a-lot-of-folks-who-lament-that-the-best-minds-of-our-generation-are-just-inventing-new-ways-to-advertise" class="headerlink" title="I know there are a lot of folks who lament that the best minds of our generation are just inventing new ways to advertise."></a>I know there are a lot of folks who lament that the best minds of our generation are just inventing new ways to advertise.</h1></blockquote><p>The thing is, that even as that becomes more evident to us, like when the Radiolab podcast did a <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/trust-engineers/">story about Facebook’s social engineering</a>, the average consumer doesn’t really seem to mind. I think we might reach a point where this intimacy that we allow, not just with other humans, but with companies and brands and governments, will encroach on our sense of well-being.</p><p>Bots as personal firewalls might be able to alleviate that for us. BigHealthInsuranceCompany™ wants to create a bot to assess my insurance claims? Ok, I’ll hire a bot to take care of the insurance claim process, and the appeals process.</p><h3 id="Often-it-is-difficult-to-discern-user’s-intent-when-communicating-via-text-based-inputs-how-does-voice-interaction-open-up-nuance-as-an-indicator-for-how-human-machine-interaction-unfolds"><a href="#Often-it-is-difficult-to-discern-user’s-intent-when-communicating-via-text-based-inputs-how-does-voice-interaction-open-up-nuance-as-an-indicator-for-how-human-machine-interaction-unfolds" class="headerlink" title="Often it is difficult to discern user’s intent when communicating via text based inputs, how does voice interaction open up nuance as an indicator for how human-machine interaction unfolds?"></a><strong>Often it is difficult to discern user’s intent when communicating via text based inputs, how does voice interaction open up nuance as an indicator for how human-machine interaction unfolds?</strong></h3><p>There are a lot of aspects of voice that expand the interaction space quite tremendously, and they exist on the machine and the human side of the interaction. Voice agents can take on personality that go beyond the words they use with sarcasm, pauses, inflection, and emotion.</p><blockquote><h1 id="Voice-agents-have-the-opportunity-to-be-somewhat-omnipresent-as-long-as-there-is-a-microphone-and-speaker-that-is-connected-to-the-agent-in-range"><a href="#Voice-agents-have-the-opportunity-to-be-somewhat-omnipresent-as-long-as-there-is-a-microphone-and-speaker-that-is-connected-to-the-agent-in-range" class="headerlink" title="Voice agents have the opportunity to be somewhat omnipresent, as long as there is a microphone and speaker that is connected to the agent in range."></a>Voice agents have the opportunity to be somewhat omnipresent, as long as there is a microphone and speaker that is connected to the agent in range.</h1></blockquote><p>This means that voice agents can be employed in contexts that we haven’t explored by being tied to manual input. They can be used while performing surgery, doing mechanical work, cooking food, or being a mom.</p><p>On the human side, we can interact with a more immediate form of input than typing. That input, beyond its intent, can be encoded with other information. There are emerging technologies like voice print that analyzes your voice and uses its distinct qualities as a form of authentication. Voice analysis in general is already being used for lie detection, diagnostics, and fraud detection. This emotional analysis of voices will become an important signal within future voice interfaces.</p><p><em>Join us Sept 28–29th in Austin, Texas to discuss bots, conversational software and community for the first ever <a href="https://talkabot.ai/">Talkabot Conference</a>.

What made you so sure about it’s potential back then?</h3><p>We were certain because we were heavy users of both the Web and Instant messaging. The prototype of SmarterChild — ActiveBuddy — the company’s original namesake — worked incredibly well. Conversational user interface benefits back then were even more significant as the Web was so slow — most people still used dial up connections; so text was even more compelling by contrast.</p><h3 id="How-important-was-natural-language-input-to-Smarterchild’s-popularity"><a href="#How-important-was-natural-language-input-to-Smarterchild’s-popularity" class="headerlink" title="How important was natural language input to Smarterchild’s popularity?"></a>How important was natural language input to Smarterchild’s popularity?</h3><p>Super important. But even back then we didn’t consider ourselves to be a ‘natural language’ we were a chat and messaging company. And chat is different than natural language. So we focused our energy and attention on being really good at understanding and responding to chat in the most natural way possible within a messaging context.</p><h3 id="Do-you-think-today’s-bot-users-have-higher-expectations-with-regards"><a href="#Do-you-think-today’s-bot-users-have-higher-expectations-with-regards" class="headerlink" title="Do you think today’s bot users have higher expectations with regards"></a>Do you think today’s bot users have higher expectations with regards</h3><p>to bot intelligence compared to SmarterChild’s users?</p><p>They should — but it’s hard to imagine that they do. With rare exception the current crop of bots are playing catch up to where we left SmarterChild development half a decade ago. Machine learning and NLU systems only go so far — the technology is part of the equation but editorial and context — writing in a personality — is the other part of the equation.

What made you so sure about it’s potential back<br>then?*</p><p>There were a could of major cool factors that excited us. First, was the essential concept of people being able to have a conversation with a computer. Out bots offered both information and fun — the personality aspect was critical. Second, you have to remember the fact that we were still living in a dial-up world.</p><blockquote><h1 id="The-speed-of-response-that-we-offered-via-IM-was-astounding"><a href="#The-speed-of-response-that-we-offered-via-IM-was-astounding" class="headerlink" title="The speed of response that we offered via IM was astounding."></a>The speed of response that we offered via IM was astounding.</h1></blockquote><p>The ask for info and answer took 1 to 2 seconds — max.

Over the years we’ve seen the complaints about using Siri. People will give a bot a chance, but not for too long if the bot does not seem like a solution. Hmmm, is anyone doing consumer research about bots?</p><h3 id="Compared-to-the-1990’s-the-market-for-bot-products-is-arguably-wider"><a href="#Compared-to-the-1990’s-the-market-for-bot-products-is-arguably-wider" class="headerlink" title="*Compared to the 1990’s, the market for bot products is arguably wider"></a>*Compared to the 1990’s, the market for bot products is arguably wider</h3><p>today. What do you think a SmarterChild would look like in 2016?*</p><p>One of our dreams, and yes this can be a bit creepy if done incorrectly, was that SmarterChild would become your BFF. It amassed a data set based on your interactions, remembered your queries, could anticipate your needs and became your ultimate digital personal diary (your DPD.)</p><p>Unfortunately, it kinda became a lame customer service bot given Microsoft’s limited horizons. They purchased the technology but not the vision or the soul.</p><p>And, its all about vision and soul.</p><p><em>Join us Sept 28–29th in Austin, Texas to discuss bots, conversational software and community for the first ever <a href="https://talkabot.ai/">Talkabot Conference</a>.

With <a href="http://www.automat.ai/">Automat.ai</a>, he is building tools to “make it easier for anyone to build a messaging experience that uses artificial intelligence and human expertise to enable business conversations at scale”*</p><h3 id="How-important-will-conversational-UI-be-to-the-next-wave-of-web-applications"><a href="#How-important-will-conversational-UI-be-to-the-next-wave-of-web-applications" class="headerlink" title="How important will conversational UI be to the next wave of web applications?"></a>How important will conversational UI be to the next wave of web applications?</h3><p>While bots have much in common with web applications in that they live in the cloud and are quick and easy to update without requiring publishing and distribution approvals like mobile apps, they are something new and different.</p><p>Benedict Evans has asked whether chat bots will become a “third runtime”, and we are seeing early signs that brands both big and small think the answer is yes. But the real meat of your question is related to conversational UI, namely is conversational UI more about the conversation or more about the UI?</p><p>Opinions here are very divided but I come down squarely in the middle which is that you need both graphical interface affordances and also conversational language understanding to fulfill user’s expectations. I’ll go into depth on this topic at Talkabot but for now let me simply leave you with a question:</p><blockquote><h1 id="What-would-the-web-be-like-if-we-could-only-click-links-and-browse-and-we-didn’t-have-powerful-natural-language-search-It’d-be-Lycos-Remember-Lycos-You-don’t-wanna-remember-Lycos"><a href="#What-would-the-web-be-like-if-we-could-only-click-links-and-browse-and-we-didn’t-have-powerful-natural-language-search-It’d-be-Lycos-Remember-Lycos-You-don’t-wanna-remember-Lycos" class="headerlink" title="What would the web be like if we could only click links and browse and we didn’t have powerful natural language search?

It’d be Lycos. Remember Lycos? You don’t wanna remember Lycos.</h1></blockquote><p>But you also wouldn’t want to live in an “I’m Feeling Lucky” search only world either.

In other words, you’ll be able to improve both the depth and breadth of your products.</p><p>Conversational interfaces are going to let companies both big and small make their customers happier, and make more money. The trick here though is to have this learning happen by the machine.</p><blockquote><h1 id="Many-bot-companies-will-tell-you-they-can-learn-but-what-they-really-mean-is-that-they-can-look-at-logs-and-manually-program-in-new-features"><a href="#Many-bot-companies-will-tell-you-they-can-learn-but-what-they-really-mean-is-that-they-can-look-at-logs-and-manually-program-in-new-features" class="headerlink" title="Many bot companies will tell you they can learn but what they really mean is that they can look at logs and manually program in new features."></a>Many bot companies will tell you they can learn but what they really mean is that they can look at logs and manually program in new features.</h1></blockquote><p>Companies looking to adopt technology in this space should be looking for solutions that have some level of automated learning.</p><p><img src="!%5B%5D(https://peterswimm.com/images/medium/1_GMrePnvrqkVOPT6hDwvXkg.jpeg" alt="Andy speaking at [Startup Fest 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldVUO7oS_Uk)"><em>Andy speaking at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldVUO7oS_Uk">Startup Fest 2016</a></em></p><h3 id="What-are-the-challenges-of-communicating-entirely-via-text-with-users-from-various-backgrounds"><a href="#What-are-the-challenges-of-communicating-entirely-via-text-with-users-from-various-backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="What are the challenges of communicating entirely via text with users from various backgrounds?"></a>What are the challenges of communicating entirely via text with users from various backgrounds?</h3><p>Trying to deal with different accents and dialects can be a real challenge in an audio environment. While I am bullish long term on voice interfaces, after many years focusing in this area we found that mobile users really don’t want to talk to their devices.</p><p>Accounting for all of mobile utilization voice input accounts for less than 1% of overall usage.</p><blockquote><h1 id="Users-don’t-mind-doing-the-odd-voice-search-or-setting-an-alarm-but-that-is-a-far-cry-from-having-a-conversation"><a href="#Users-don’t-mind-doing-the-odd-voice-search-or-setting-an-alarm-but-that-is-a-far-cry-from-having-a-conversation" class="headerlink" title="Users don’t mind doing the odd voice search or setting an alarm, but that is a far cry from having a conversation."></a>Users don’t mind doing the odd voice search or setting an alarm, but that is a far cry from having a conversation.</h1></blockquote><p>Voice is successful in the home and in the car where people don’t mind talking, but generally speaking people use their thumbs to interact with their mobile devices.</p><p>That said, just because we’re dealing with text doesn’t remove the interesting challenges. Modern mobile messaging is about far more than just text, it includes emoji, stickers, animated gifs, video, images and increasingly rich GUI elements.</p><blockquote><h1 id="Working-all-of-these-features-into-a-conversation-requires-a-whole-new-set-of-technology-and-design-innovations"><a href="#Working-all-of-these-features-into-a-conversation-requires-a-whole-new-set-of-technology-and-design-innovations" class="headerlink" title="Working all of these features into a conversation requires a whole new set of technology and design innovations."></a>Working all of these features into a conversation requires a whole new set of technology and design innovations.</h1></blockquote><p>We see a lot of folks making the mistake in thinking that messaging is an extension of web chat, or in-app chat. Messaging is an evolution of text interfaces but is really coming into its own as something new. And of course Messaging is inclusive of voice and video calling so we’ll eventually have to deal with that side of things as well.</p><h3 id="What-opportunities-are-there-for-brands-to-engage-potential-customers-via-communicating-via-natural-language"><a href="#What-opportunities-are-there-for-brands-to-engage-potential-customers-via-communicating-via-natural-language" class="headerlink" title="What opportunities are there for brands to engage potential customers via communicating via natural language?"></a>What opportunities are there for brands to engage potential customers via communicating via natural language?</h3><p>I prefer to use the term Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) rather than natural language understanding (NLU) because I think the opportunity really stems from understanding the entire conversation, and maybe even spanning across conversations.</p><blockquote><h1 id="Previous-generations-of-NLU-technology-have-disappointed-because-they’ve-mostly-only-been-able-to-do-transactions"><a href="#Previous-generations-of-NLU-technology-have-disappointed-because-they’ve-mostly-only-been-able-to-do-transactions" class="headerlink" title="Previous generations of NLU technology have disappointed because they’ve mostly only been able to do transactions."></a>Previous generations of NLU technology have disappointed because they’ve mostly only been able to do transactions.</h1></blockquote><p>Years ago my team and I built a system that could understand very long sentences and very accurately pluck out the various words from a sentence to do things like pay bills or order pizza.</p><p>Turns out human beings aren’t put on the planet to complete transactions. They have questions, they want to joke around, make a connection and feel like they’re being heard. It’s traditionally been hard and expensive to manually update a conversational system and so most prior generations, be it phone IVR or mobile assistants have been brittle and not typically associated with “engaging” customers.</p><blockquote><h1 id="I-believe-messaging-and-bots-will-finally-allow-us-to-invent-the-right-technology-and-design-patterns-that-will-drive-end-user-engagement"><a href="#I-believe-messaging-and-bots-will-finally-allow-us-to-invent-the-right-technology-and-design-patterns-that-will-drive-end-user-engagement" class="headerlink" title="I believe messaging and bots will finally allow us to invent the right technology and design patterns that will drive end user engagement."></a>I believe messaging and bots will finally allow us to invent the right technology and design patterns that will drive end user engagement.</h1></blockquote><p>I believe we’ll see bots that become iconic for brands and that span entertainment, marketing, sales and not just in the obvious customer service use case. I also think we’ll see scenarios where bots and human experts will reinforce one another and create new types of jobs and end user experiences that far surpass the one size fits all web pages and mobile apps we’ve all gotten used to.</p><p><em>Join us Sept 28–29th in Austin, Texas to discuss bots, conversational software and community for the first ever <a href="https://talkabot.ai/">Talkabot Conference</a>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post originally appeared on the <a href="https://medium.com/talkabot/talkabot-talks-2016-round-up-cdfeb0a0739">the Howdy.ai company blog</a> to promote the <a href="https://talkabot.ai/">Talkabot Conference</a></em></p><p><a href="https://electrobabe.at/">*Barbara is a software developer</a> whose bot, <a href="https://hipstercatbot.com">Mica, the Hipster Cat Bot</a>, is a friendly venue recommendation bot for various messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Skype and more. As one of the featured speakers at <a href="https://talkabot.ai/">next month’s Talkabot Conference</a>, she spoke to us about the challenges a developer faces when trying to make a bot that is both friendly and useful.*</p><h3 id="What-kind-of-feedback-have-you-gotten-from-users-of-Mica"><a href="#What-kind-of-feedback-have-you-gotten-from-users-of-Mica" class="headerlink" title="What kind of feedback have you gotten from users of Mica?"></a><em>What kind of feedback have you gotten from users of Mica?</em></h3><p>I basically received very positive feedback about <a href="https://hipstercatbot.com">Mica, the Hipster Cat Bot</a><a href="https://hipstercatbot.com.">.</a> People love the combination of a cat and trendy venues and like the results of Mica!</p><p>With Mica I learned a lot about user experience-design. Most people just try out which combinations or commands a chatbot understands and where its capabilities and limitations lie. For instance, there is still no common standard established for chatbots, although most understand “hi”, “start” and “help”.</p><blockquote><h1 id="There-is-still-no-common-standard-established-for-chatbots-although-most-understand-“hi”-“start”-and-“help”"><a href="#There-is-still-no-common-standard-established-for-chatbots-although-most-understand-“hi”-“start”-and-“help”" class="headerlink" title="There is still no common standard established for chatbots, although most understand “hi”, “start” and “help”."></a>There is still no common standard established for chatbots, although most understand “hi”, “start” and “help”.</h1></blockquote><p>People also get upset easily when a bot does not meet their expectation. In order not to frustrate my users, Mica sends a funny cat picture to entertain if she doesn’t find venues in the vicinity or does not understand the request. Mica is polite and responds accordingly with basic conversation skills.</p><h3 id="How-do-you-decide-what-sort-of-tone-and-approach-to-use-when-dealing-with-users-as-a-chatbot"><a href="#How-do-you-decide-what-sort-of-tone-and-approach-to-use-when-dealing-with-users-as-a-chatbot" class="headerlink" title="How do you decide what sort of tone and approach to use when dealing with users as a chatbot?"></a><em>How do you decide what sort of tone and approach to use when dealing with users as a chatbot?</em></h3><p><img src="https://peterswimm.com/images/medium/1_Z8bKpSs1ABVPqy_n1UeEnw.png" alt=""></p><p>Mica is based on my cat, my real cat, at home. Mica is friendly, always hungry, sometimes a bit intrusive. She also likes hip and trendy coffee shops, she likes to share funny cat pictures and doesn’t like water. Although the hipster mustache implies a male character, Mica is a female cat.</p><p>To begin with, Mica was chosen (as a joke) as the official “Head of Communication” to be addressed for PR requests with another project of mine: <a href="https://likeahipster.com">LIKE A HIPSTER.</a></p><p>I also decided to use a cat as the character to chat with because I think every single cat owner would love to actually talk to their cat! Also, people tend to be disturbed when they cannot distinguish whether they are chatting with a person or a computer program. Thus, I chose Mica as the perfect dialog partner.</p><blockquote><h1 id="People-tend-to-be-disturbed-when-they-cannot-distinguish-whether-they-are-chatting-with-a-person-or-a-computer-program"><a href="#People-tend-to-be-disturbed-when-they-cannot-distinguish-whether-they-are-chatting-with-a-person-or-a-computer-program" class="headerlink" title="People tend to be disturbed when they cannot distinguish whether they are chatting with a person or a computer program."></a>People tend to be disturbed when they cannot distinguish whether they are chatting with a person or a computer program.</h1></blockquote><h3 id="Have-you-learned-anything-unexpected-from-your-interactions-with-users-since-you’ve-started"><a href="#Have-you-learned-anything-unexpected-from-your-interactions-with-users-since-you’ve-started" class="headerlink" title="Have you learned anything unexpected from your interactions with users since you’ve started?"></a><em>Have you learned anything unexpected from your interactions with users since you’ve started?</em></h3><p>Some people start to swear just for fun or send disturbing questions such as “where is Barbara?” ;)</p><p>Since Mica also has quite a narrow aim (to find hip venues worldwide), people are usually quickly satisfied when trying a chat.</p><p><em>Join us Sept 28–29th in Austin, Texas to discuss bots, conversational software and community for the first ever <a href="https://talkabot.ai/">Talkabot Conference</a>.

When they agreed, we realized we had something really relevant and exciting to build a conference around.

Using a text messaging interface, users can easily tune breaking news and long form content to their tastes, and prior to their appears at <a href="http://talkabot.ai">Talkabot Conference,</a> spoke with us on the changing media landscape and how people can use Quartz to change the way they consume news.*</p><h3 id="What-are-the-differences-in-the-way-people-consume-news-using-the-Quartz-app"><a href="#What-are-the-differences-in-the-way-people-consume-news-using-the-Quartz-app" class="headerlink" title="What are the differences in the way people consume news using the Quartz app?"></a><strong>What are the differences in the way people consume news using the Quartz app?</strong></h3><p>Readers of the Quartz app get their news in a form similar to text messaging. The reader gets a message from us introducing a story, and we present them with the option to read more (usually in the form of an emoji) or skip to the next news items.</p><blockquote><h1 id="It’s-sort-of-like-a-choose-your-own-adventure-for-news"><a href="#It’s-sort-of-like-a-choose-your-own-adventure-for-news" class="headerlink" title="It’s sort of like a choose-your-own-adventure for news."></a>It’s sort of like a choose-your-own-adventure for news.</h1></blockquote><p>We also send out notifications that are intended to be more fun and useful than what you might expect from a news app.</p><p><img src="https://peterswimm.com/images/medium/1_XD8LnILsyRi7mYyH6XMqZg.jpeg" alt=""></p><h3 id="What-opportunities-does-the-Quartz-app-create-for-journalists"><a href="#What-opportunities-does-the-Quartz-app-create-for-journalists" class="headerlink" title="What opportunities does the Quartz app create for journalists?"></a><strong>What opportunities does the Quartz app create for journalists?</strong></h3><p>It’s an opportunity to try writing news in a completely different style. They need to write both sides of a conversation, and the tone is different than what you would usually find in a story on our website. It’s also a great opportunity to show off their excellent GIF curation skills.</p><blockquote><h1 id="J-ournalists-need-to-write-both-sides-of-a-conversation-and-the-tone-is-different-than-what-you-would-usually-find-in-a-story-on-our-website"><a href="#J-ournalists-need-to-write-both-sides-of-a-conversation-and-the-tone-is-different-than-what-you-would-usually-find-in-a-story-on-our-website" class="headerlink" title="(J)ournalists need to write both sides of a conversation, and the tone is different than what you would usually find in a story on our website."></a>(J)ournalists need to write both sides of a conversation, and the tone is different than what you would usually find in a story on our website.</h1></blockquote><h3 id="Why-is-a-chat-based-conversational-UI-for-consuming-information-such-a-natural-fit-for-consuming-news"><a href="#Why-is-a-chat-based-conversational-UI-for-consuming-information-such-a-natural-fit-for-consuming-news" class="headerlink" title="Why is a chat based conversational UI for consuming information such a natural fit for consuming news?"></a><strong>Why is a chat based conversational UI for consuming information such a natural fit for consuming news?</strong></h3><p>Well, for one, it’s just fun. I would say that a chat interface is a natural extension of notifications, which is how this project began. In fact, an early version of the app was just a blank screen, with the only content delivered through notifications.</p><blockquote><h1 id="Chat-interface-is-a-natural-extension-of-notifications"><a href="#Chat-interface-is-a-natural-extension-of-notifications" class="headerlink" title="Chat interface is a natural extension of notifications."></a>Chat interface is a natural extension of notifications.</h1></blockquote><p>From there we started playing around with different interfaces inside the app, and once we started playing around with a chat interface, it was clear that it would work well as a complement our notifications.

I served as “executive producer” of the “restoration” of the found audio and included textual archival data. Support my friend Brady Leo and order it today from the Bandcamp link!</p><blockquote><p>Recovered from storage and forgotten about… until NOW: Resofame Recordings’ debut release! This appears to be the completed soundtrack to the never-completed film, A Laser for Lovers. It’s unclear what exactly happened with the film’s failed production. However, in 2012 we discovered a box in an abandoned storage locker containing a VHS cassette the original score (VHS allowed for higher fidelity than cassette), a (presumably) Brazilian trailer with Portuguese subtitles, an original Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge with a test ROM of the game’s intro screen and a folder with script treatments, storyboards and letters to the composer. We have painstakingly digitally restored and archived our findings and after two years of legal negotiations, we are able to share our findings with the rest of the world. BONUS! Each purchase gets a hi-res scan of the official movie poster, storyboards, production notes, Brazilian trailer and the abandoned Nintendo Entertainment System game ROM and NSF (Nintendo Sound File), ripped for your enjoyment!</p></blockquote><p>I have a few download codes to give away, so if you are a DJ, have a radio show or a podcast, or want to share the link with friends and family, hit me up in the comments!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>15-16 years ago, friends of mine participated in this online collaborative thing called ORI Epic, which was basically fanfic for a bunch of bands with mythos like Servotron, Man or Astroman, and Operation Reinformation. Hot on the heels of this, I came up with an idea with a friend of mine <a href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/anatotitan">David Orr</a> about these time traveling firefighters who solve historical fires.   Alas real life took over, and the idea was forgotten but not before this first act was emailed to Mr. <a href="http://www.rickvodicka.com/">Rick Vodicka, </a> who in kind sent it to me this week. I present to you:</p><h2 id="CHRONOFLAME-Blazing-Through-History-working-title"><a href="#CHRONOFLAME-Blazing-Through-History-working-title" class="headerlink" title="CHRONOFLAME: Blazing Through History (working title)"></a>CHRONOFLAME: Blazing Through History (working title)</h2><p>Your characters:</p><ul><li><strong>Bruno</strong>, a firefighter</li><li><strong>Rex</strong>, Bruno’s “partner”</li></ul><p>Supporting characters:</p><ul><li><strong>Moses</strong>, a cranky prophet</li><li><strong>Aaron Hitler</strong>, a European aristocrat</li><li><strong>Jonathan Brushneck</strong>, the Fire Chief who makes his own rules, but hates when you play by yours.</li><li><strong>Joaquim Slinko</strong>, a time travel specialist</li><li><strong>Dildoledes</strong>, a greek scholar in Pompeii and regular bathhouse attendee</li><li><strong>Al Capone</strong>, a mobster and setter of the Great Chicago fire</li><li><strong>Oscar Swellbelly</strong>, the firefighters’ archnemesis</li><li><strong>Pawny Mittens</strong>, Rex and Bruno’s “girlfriend”</li><li><strong>Borromel the Swarthy</strong>, holder of the sacred Encyclopedia Panmillenia</li></ul><h3 id="Act-1-Scene-1"><a href="#Act-1-Scene-1" class="headerlink" title="Act 1 Scene 1"></a>Act 1 Scene 1</h3><p><em>Downtown Dresden, 1945 6:00 PM. Fires ravage the city in the wake of Allied</em> <em>firebombing. Millions of lives are threatened. We see a dark alley in the</em> <em>heart of the city, slowly being covered in soot. All of the sudden, a powerful</em> <em>time machine rolls onto the screen. The pod bay door opens and out step Rex</em> <em>and Bruno.</em> Rex: Looks like a heavy one, Bru. Bruno: Yeah, but nothing we can’t handle… together. <em>(Lingering glance)</em> Rex: HOSE IT! <em>Foam covers the screen. Title sequence begins.</em></p><h3 id="Scene-2"><a href="#Scene-2" class="headerlink" title="Scene 2"></a>Scene 2</h3><p><em>Exterior of a expensive German estate, home of Aaron Hitler, patron to the arts.</em> Hitler: That was a close one… it almost got to the orphanage. Rex: And what’s more, we just barely saved the German poetry archive. Bruno: That was at the orphanage? Hitler: (<em>Distractedly</em>) Yes, yes of course. Bruno: Well, thanks for the hospitality, Mr. AARON Hitler…. Rex: You’re a kindly patron to the arts. Hitler: <em>(A brief intake of air, and then an exhalation of satisfaction)</em> I love children and I treat the oppressed with a gentle bearing. Rex: Indeed, you’re a man’s man. <em>(A short pause to reflect in Herr Hitler’s exuberant benevolence)</em> Hitler: Before you go, you need to see the animals. Bruno: I see two right now! <em>Camera pans to Hitler and Rex, then follows their gaze to look at mounted deer heads.</em> <em>Wipe to time travel sequence…</em></p><h3 id="Scene-3"><a href="#Scene-3" class="headerlink" title="Scene 3"></a>Scene 3</h3><p><em>(Exterior old office park, tattered sign reads Slinko’s lab.)</em> Slinko: <em>(As our heroes enter)</em> This is the best fruit chew ever! Rex: Slinko? Slinko: Welcome back, fellas! The chief wants to see you! Where have you been? I expected you back ten microns ago! <em>(Rex and Bruno stare blankly.</em>) Slinko: Chronos’ Beard! Just a little temporal humor! Get outta my lab! <em>(Cut to chief’s office.</em>) Chief Brushneck: Sit down and close the door. Okay, you two schlemiels. How many times have we been over Timecode Regulation 643A-18? <em>(They smile blandly)</em> Chief Brushneck: <em>(Holds up four fingers)</em> Four times, guys. Four times. Rex: <em>(Bored, distracted, staring at nails)</em> We can explain. Brushneck: I don’t need anymore of your little yuppie-assed explanations. You fools still have no grasp on the dire consequences <em>(dramatic muzik)</em> of your actions while in the Chronozone. We are talking Irreversible damage to the fabric of time… and neither of you have a sewing machine big enough for that job. Bruno: <em>(Standing, Spotlight)</em> My grandmother was 6’2.” Her arms were the limbs of a redwood. She could split an apple in her fist. Once, she gave my entire seventh grade class a whupping we wouldn’t soon forget! I’ll tell you one thing– I’ll never play tether-ball in the orchard again. Brushneck: <em>(Engrossed in the digression, but irritated)</em> Could she sew? Bruno: Oh, yes sir! She could sew circles ‘round ‘most any woman in the county! Even ol’ Hattie McCane was little more than a funhouse reflection in Granny’s chaw-spit when it came to sewing. Fabric of space? P’shaw, I reckon she could sew a half-inch seam in it faster than you can whistle “It’s Raining Men!” Brushneck: Wow… <em>(Thoughtful pause)</em>. You know what… HOW ABOUT YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP? You screw up like this one more time and you are off the squad, for good! And to make sure you don’t drop the ball again, I’m assigning you two another partner. Rex: Who? <em>(Bruno figures it out first, and groans with growing agitation)</em> Brushneck: Borromel? Get your fuzzy ass in here. Rex: The pooch?!?! Brushneck: That’s right. Ladies, allow me to introduce Borromel the Swarthy, holder of the Encyclopedia Panmillenia. If you guys fudge up with this …thing… on your side, I’ll personally tear your Chronolicenses a new pie chute. <em>(Borromel enters with an dramatic flourish)</em> Borromel:  Sir, I must protest. I am currently in the throes of a scientific fit! Research for the next edition of the Encyclopedia is only up to the P’s…  this is of paramount importance. Brushneck: Go tell it on the mountain, poochie. You, Rex, and Bruno are a team. And in the next 24 microhours, you’re leaving for Pompeii, Greece. Now get your bony china-white asses out of this office and into the Chronoprep Bay, ASAPMOFO. Borromel, Rex, Bruno: But… Brushneck: (<em>insistently</em>) GO! <em>To Be Continued… (No it won’t)</em></p>]]></content>

      <title>Review: LPH-001 Quik Lok Stand</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/923959_644898405559406_1381300487_n.jpg"><img src="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/923959_644898405559406_1381300487_n.jpg" alt="923959_644898405559406_1381300487_n"></a> The worst part (well except for just about everything else) about being a electronic dude is the table situations in clubs. They are meant for setting drinks on, not making the artist look like a tall confident performer. Every schlub with a laptop has a picture where they are huddled <a href="http://www.chiptography.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/BlipFest2011_Day3_054-685x1024.jpg">nebbishly over their arcane gear</a>, and frankly I am sick of it, so I went out and did what EDM artists do best with problems: THROW MONEY AT IT. Enter the <a href="http://www.peterswimm.com/review-lph-001quik-lok-stand/">Quik Lok LPH-001</a>. This company makes all kinds of stuff to hold your stuff on, and this stand is NO EXCEPTION. It will hold the fuck out of your mixer, your little keyboards, an <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/push/">Ableton Push</a>, WHAT THE FUCK EVER. Anything you got (probably under 15 lbs or so to be on the safe side) will proudly be held erect by the stand with its relatively sturdy tripod design. If you are some mincing laptop dude it’ll hold that too, but why bother pretending you are a proud member of the homo sapien genus, if all you are going to do is just stand up and run MMC transport, right?</p><ul><li>Pros: Its a stand. Its black. It holds your moderately size junk at a height that befits your standing in society. Rubber strips keep stuff from sliding around on the surface.</li><li>Cons: It doesn’t lower very well, so if you are Mr. Shortstuff, you might to try it on before you take it home. You can set it pretty high but then it becomes super precarious so whats the point? Just get a keytar strap and rock out like your nerd frat is rocking the greek games already. Doesn’t come in colors other than black if you have a problem with shades that match everything.</li><li>Final Verdict: If you got $40 USD and a sore back, there are worse things to waste money on.</li></ul>]]></content>

      <title>Wave Mixing in LSDJ with Monowave</title>
      <link href="2013/10/21/wave-mixing-in-lsdj-with-monowave/"/>
      <url>2013/10/21/wave-mixing-in-lsdj-with-monowave/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116407271&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe><p>Within the recent updates to LittleSoundDJ comes a fix for the kits wave mixing, meaning better sample playback and improvement of a  great sound design trick for LSDJ hackers. I started off with importing a complex waveform with single cycle elements, <a href="http://hexawe.net/compos/monorave/">Monowave</a>. The results were pretty interesting. The key to all the below sounds is using wave mixing and manipulating the resulting offsets between the waveforms to make interesting drones that you can control in various ways. The basic process is:</p><ul><li>Load the kit file (at the end of the article) into a blank space on your ROM</li><li>Load a instrument and load your kit into both slots</li><li>Pitch is very broad, so you might want to layer the sound on top of a pulse note to help tune it. AFAICT it is in cents, more or less.</li><li>Offset will select which step in the waveform the loop will start. You can set both to the same value or slightly offset for cool phasing tricks.</li><li>Len is how big the looped section will be. a LEN of 1, is basically a single cycle, and big LENS play more of the sample. Monowave has cool fake filter sweep sections in it, so play around with the kit.</li><li>LOOP should be set to on</li><li>Speed can be used to half the drone pitch. Heavy Bass!</li><li>DIST is another tool to really grime the sound up, be sure to dig the settings mentioned in the manuals hidden mode.</li></ul><p>The biggest issue  is this process will murder your DMG-01’s CPU. You will probably have better results on a GBA SP, or even a Color Gameboy. Using the latest version of LSDJ is strongly recommended as well. I posted some screenshots of the patches in the demo below:</p><h3 id="Snare-Sound"><a href="#Snare-Sound" class="headerlink" title="Snare Sound"></a>Snare Sound</h3><p><a href="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snare.png"><img src="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snare.png" alt=""></a></p><h3 id="Bass-Sound"><a href="#Bass-Sound" class="headerlink" title="Bass Sound"></a>Bass Sound</h3><p><a href="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/BASS.png"><img src="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/BASS.png" alt="BASS"></a></p><h3 id="Drone-Sound"><a href="#Drone-Sound" class="headerlink" title="Drone Sound"></a>Drone Sound</h3><p><a href="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DRONE.png"><img src="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DRONE.png" alt="DRONE"></a> <a href="http://www.toilville.com/piggy/bgwave.kit">Download the Kit</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lsdpatch/">Patch your ROM</a> Let me know feedback on the kit and what cool sounds you guys come up with.

      <title>New Arduinoboy from XIWI Electronics</title>
      <link href="2013/06/23/new-arduinoboy-from-xiwi-electronics/"/>
      <url>2013/06/23/new-arduinoboy-from-xiwi-electronics/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1332_1024x683_1024x1024.jpg"><img src="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_1332_1024x683_1024x1024.jpg" alt="IMG_1332_1024x683_1024x1024"></a> For the last few years I have been abusing the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/arduinoboy/">Arduinoboy</a> Midiout feature in my sets to control my external midi gear with my Nintendo Game Boy running <a href="http://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/">LSDJ.</a> This has allowed me to focus on crowd control and trying to remember the three chords each song has with some decent results. For most of that time I have been using a Scienceguy built unit, but I have never been happy about its build quality and worried about the day when the unit finally bites the dust. Recently I saw a new product from Brooklyn based tinkerer <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130613232915/http://xiwielectronics.com:80/products/arduinoboy">XIWI Electronics</a> which looked pretty robust and I figured what the hell, and ordered a unit from their online shop. The unit itself is solidly built. It has sleek looks and the detachable link cable and power supply are handy in connecting to my various Game Boy units. One thing I noticed is that some modded Game Boys are no longer able to power the Scienceguy via the link cable, so having external power is something I will have to research to see if it has any impact on solving the issue. The unit is powered using my Voodoo Labs pedal power unit that I use to power my Nord Micro Modular, my Shruthi-1, and various other gear with no complaints. The push button looks gorgeous and feels great, but in operation it is a little finicky and may require double presses to select the various modes. In actual operation, it works like pretty much every other Arduinoboy. Some users have reported problems in getting their Arduinoboy to send midi properly, so here are my settings via the maxpat editor found on the Arduinoboy website: <a href="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-23_1113.png"><img src="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-23_1113.png" alt="2013-06-23_1113"></a> A quick note: - I use four channels of midi. 1,2,4 are controlling synths so they are just assigned one CC, CC1 for modulation. The whole range of the CC is scaled across the usable range of the CC message. The noise channel is mapped to channel 3 which controls all my various effects boxes. Here I use various CC messages to toggle on and off various effect settings for my guitars and vocals. This is a very robust unit high value unit that simply works as advertised. The unit is sturdy and reliable in limited testing and is a good product for those who are looking for getting into LSDJ syncing and external midi control. If anyone has questions please post them in the comments.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Tutorial: Using Soundfonts in Littlegptracker</title>
      <link href="2013/01/16/tutorial-using-soundfonts-in-littlegptracker/"/>
      <url>2013/01/16/tutorial-using-soundfonts-in-littlegptracker/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/piggy_k9d2x.jpg"><img src="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/piggy_k9d2x.jpg" alt="" title="piggy_k9d2x"></a> <em>Updated 04/02/15: Fixed errors, adding some additional information.</em> One of the more overlooked (and unknown) features of <a href="http://littlegptracker.com/">Littlegptracker</a> is it’s ability to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundFont">soundfonts</a> for audio sources. To help clarify things up I decided to put together a short how-to to cover how it works.</p><h3 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h3><p>If you have read the links above you already know what soundfonts and littlegptracker (piggy) are, so let’s focus on what the implementation is like and what you can do. The piggy sample browser does not yet support soundfont browsing, so to create a project you will need:</p><ul><li>To manually create a folder: <em>ex. lgpt_Soundfonts</em></li><li>In this folder create a subfolder name: <em>samples</em></li><li>In this folder copy one soundfont.</li></ul><p>I have posted an example project with samples from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_MT-32">MT-32</a> here: <a href="http://hexawe.net/mess/sf2/lgptMT32.zip">http://hexawe.net/mess/sf2/lgptMT32.zip</a> You can just unzip and drop this in your project folder to try it out. When you start your piggy project for the first time you will find that whatever soundfont you have loaded now has its instruments assigned to each piggy instrument. <a href="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Soundfonts.png"><img src="http://www.peterswimm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Soundfonts.png" alt="" title="Soundfonts"></a> There are a few features/drawbacks you should be aware of.</p><h3 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h3><ul><li>If the soundfont has loop points they are automatically selected. You will need to do your own vol fades and kills in the pattern to stop the loop from playing.</li><li>You can adjust the pitch of the sample playing back by adjusting <em>ROOT NOTE</em>.</li><li>Instruments that are multisampled will be layered across the range of the keyboard per the soundfont settings. Drum kits for example will be assigned to each note. String samples will be correctly assigned so the better the quality of your soundfont the more realistic your sample will be.</li><li>You still have the full assortment of bit reducing, and filter options to mangle the sound.</li><li>You can use a combination of soundfont and midi instruments in your project.</li><li>You can change the soundfont sample assigned to each instrument if you want to create different instruments with different filter or panning options. Try adding a filter cut to a cello sound to make it sound like it is coming from farther back in the “room”.</li><li>You can purge instruments to free up instrument slots, the soundfont instruments are still available in your sample pool when browsing.</li><li>All of your non loop based piggy effects commands work, pan, filters, retrig .. go nuts!</li></ul><h3 id="Drawbacks"><a href="#Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks"></a>Drawbacks</h3><ul><li>You cannot delete or add samples to the soundfont once you start editing it seems. You can always add or remove samples to your font using a tool like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011170814/http://www.sf2midi.com/news/vienna-soundfont-studio.html">Vienna</a> for windows or <a href="http://www.polyphone.fr/">Polyphone</a> for osx</li><li>Larger soundfonts will load slow on handheld devices (sorry psp users!).</li><li>You cannot purge soundfont samples you don’t use from the project to reduce folder size</li><li>Piggy does not support advanced soundfont features like reverb, chorus, or advanced modulations or articulations.</li><li>It will not honor release points, so you have to fade out the loop part, which may sound weird in some fonts</li><li>You can only load three soundfonts per project (but each font can have up to 128 instruments!)</li></ul><p>That is basically all there is. There are millions of <a href="http://www.hammersound.net/">soundfonts</a> available on the net, so feel free to experiment and report bugs and weirdness on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130327213742/http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/littlegptracker/">Piggy mailing list</a> or <a href="http://chipmusic.org/forums/forum/33/littlegptracker/">official forum</a>.

The five tracks here in ‘Vainglory’, his first EP for Pause, dance effortlessly from melody to noise, from ecstatic joy to existential dread, in tessellations so subtle, so intricate, that at the end of its slight 20 minutes you will marvel at the distance you’ve sonically covered. Copy written by yours truly. If you want me to wax at length about your musicality, drop me a line! You can also read an abbreviated version of the copy and comment on this amazing release over at <a href="http://www.iimusic.net/catalog/2011/09/jay-tholen-vainglory">Pause</a>.</p>]]></content>

First I am doing a workshop at 2600’s <a href="http://thenexthope.org/">THE NEXT HOPE</a> on July 16th. From the description (<a href="http://www.2600.com/news/view/article/11972">via</a>):</p><blockquote><p>Introduction to the Chip Scene: Low Bit Music and Visuals Don Miller, Peter Swimm, Joey Mariano This talk will focus on the global chip scene, an ever growing group of electronic artists that use low-bit and hacked computer and video game consoles to create music and video. Peter Swimm of True Chip Till Death will give an overview of the chip scene past and present. True Chip Till Death is the leading news site of the scene, providing thousands of fans with the latest news on releases, hard- and software, and live events. Joey Mariano and Don Miller will focus on the creation of music and visuals. Mariano, better known as Animal Style, is a musician from Philadelphia who creates music on the Nintendo Game Boy and Sega Genesis. He will give an introduction to various trackers, the tools most chip musicians use to create low-bit music. Miller, also known as NO CARRIER, will be discussing real time visuals. He’ll show you how to use your Nintendo Entertainment System, the Commodore 64, and other classic hardware to create live video for chip music events.</p></blockquote><p>But before that catch me at <a href="http://8static.com/">8static</a>:</p><p><strong>Saturday, July 10th, 2010 7:00pm at Studio 34 - all ages!</strong></p><p><strong>Music by:</strong> <a href="http://www.neilvoss.com/">Neil Voss</a> (NYC) <a href="http://www.myspace.com/voidvision">Void Vision</a> (PHL) <a href="../">Peter Swimm</a> (NYC) <a href="http://dapantz.com/">Da Pantz</a> (NYC) <strong>Visuals by:</strong> <a href="http://www.waitforvblank.com/">VBLANK</a> (PHL) <strong>FREE pre-show event:</strong> <a href="http://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/">LSDJ</a> music workshop by <a href="http://www.animal-style.com/">Animal Style</a></p>]]></content>

Excerpt:</p><blockquote><p>“The [bands] that are happening are not nostalgic” said Peter Swimm, editor at <a href="http://truechiptilldeath.com/">TrueChipTillDeath.com</a>, a chiptune news and advocate site based in New York. “I think fans are just recognizing an interesting new sound.” Swimm said that the fan base for chiptune tends to skew younger, somewhere in the 16 to 24 age range, which puts the top of that range just at the year of the NES’s release. Swimm insists that while some fans may have a tinge of nostalgia for the sounds of old games, the personal connections to games are typically thin, and in some cases, non-existent.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090810235329/http://gamesblog.ugo.com/games/anamanaguchi-kicks-off-u-s-tour-chiptune-will-never-be-the-same">Read More:</a></p>]]></content>

For fans of Pulsewave, Bent Fest, or live high energy electronics, the following acts are ready to get you prepared for no holds barred excitement. Burnkit2600 <a href="http://burnkit2600.com/">http://burnkit2600.com/</a> Burnkit2600 have been breaking the sound barrier since 1997 with their unique combination of electronic genres and oddball instrumentation. Their latest release, THIS IS THE SOUND!, features circuit-bent drums, ancient video game hardware, zombie howls, and organized chaos. Receptors <a href="http://receptorsmusic.com/mwaabio.html">http://receptorsmusic.com/mwaabio.html</a> RECEPTORS is electronic artist/producer/gearhead Jeremy Kolosine aka Ksine, founder of electro pioneers Futurisk, and chiptune/bitpop vanguards 8-Bit Operators, among other projext. In recent years, Receptors has performed at NYC’s legendary Blip Fest, CMJ and Bent Festivals, showcased at Austin, Texas’ SXSW Festival and Iceland’s Airwaves Fest, and in 2007 Jeremy Kolosine performed the first ever circuit-bent performance with a full symphony orchestra (The Roanoke Symphony). This will be his first all DS-10 set. Peter Swimm <a href="http://www.toilville.com/">http://www.toilville.com/</a> In a time lost to history, Peter Swimm battles ceaselessly in gladiatorial combat, designed for the benefit of the fatted aristocracy. There, exposed to the sons of a thousand years of slavery from around the world, he begins to combine and develop new fighting styles, melding the tenacity of doom metal, the synthetic blips of cold new wave, and the sparse ambiance of surf punk, and the unbridled rage of the disenfranchised.</p>]]></content>

NEXUS has invited artists, musicians, performers, djs, activists, poets, scholars, local community groups and other members of the public to use the radio broadcast during gallery hours, Wednesday through Sunday 12 to 6 PM. The broadcast can be heard at 1650 AM. NEXUSradio is a celebration of radio’s legacy, the evolution of communication technology, and a reaction to the current state of commercial media. The exhibition explores highly intimate auditory experiences, the radio signal’,’s idiosyncratic nature and radio’s own rich history through a two-month broadcast of participatory community based free-form radio. NEXUSradio is a platform for artists to investigate radio’s potential as a medium and art making space through live performance, transmission and direct interaction with audience members. NEXUSradio reintroduces a sense of urgency into our media landscape by intentionally not providing an internet stream. By making the broadcast purely analog, listeners have to be in the surrounding area in order to tune in. NEXUSradio can be heard at 1650 AM.</p></blockquote><p>We’ll be on the airwaves from noon till 3pm on Saturday, December 20th! This is just one in a number of many events to promote 8static - watch out for Philly in 2009!!! <strong>Highlights include: -Live sets from Alex Mauer, Animal Style, Cheap Dinosaurs, and Peter Swimm -Everyone involved will be interviewed and play some of their favorite chip songs (scene and game music) -Songs from the artists playing the first three months of the new Philly chip monthly: 8static -Mystery guests (just kidding - I’m just trying to cash in the fame of 2PP’s mystery guest!) -More shit that will happen magically when we run out of time and need to fill space!</strong> The only drawback? Gotta live in Philly to listen! This shit is analog only on the AM dial! Don’t worry, though - it’ll be recorded and available for download soon enough! Thanks for reading!</p>]]></content>
