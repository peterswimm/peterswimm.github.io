![Peter Swimm - AI Expert and Product Leader][artistRendering]

**Peter Swimm is a seasoned conversational AI expert and product management leader with over 20 years of experience transforming how organizations harness artificial intelligence.** As Toilville's founder and CEO, Peter helps businesses become "multi-modal-ready conversational powerhouses" by leveraging institutional knowledge and human expertise to drive meaningful digital transformation.

Peter's career demonstrates a unique blend of technical prowess and visionary thinking. **His passion for democratizing AI technologies has led him to develop accessible tools that enable both technical and non-technical users to leverage conversational AI.** His philosophy centers on the principle that "the best systems will always amplify human excellence, not paywall it or block it."

## Key Achievements in Conversational AI {#achievements}

**As a core member of the [Botkit team](https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/19/botkit-makes-it-easier-for-developers-to-build-bots-for-slack-and-other-messaging-platforms/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Peter served as Product Manager for the groundbreaking open-source chatbot framework that attracted over 360,000 developers worldwide.** At [Howdy (XOXCO)](https://github.com/microsoft/botkit){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, he led the product strategy and development of multiple pioneering solutions, including the Howdy chatbot for Slack and Botkit Studio IDE. His product leadership and strategic vision culminated in [Microsoft's acquisition](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/01/03/the-golden-opportunity-for-american-ai/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which now forms the foundation of the Microsoft Bot Framework.

At [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Peter spearheaded generative and conversational AI solutions for enterprise environments. **His design of the connection ecosystem became the foundation of Microsoft's approach to using LLMs in business applications.** He delivered critical functionality for customizing NLU models and architected the ecosystem supporting LLM-powered actions.

## Industry Leadership {#leadership}

**Peter co-founded the [Talkabot Conference](https://www.talkabot.ai/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the industry's first dedicated conversational AI event.** His thought leadership extends to interviews with [Authority Magazine](https://authority.com/interviews/peter-swimm){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [ValiantCEO](https://valiantceo.com/peter-swimm-interview){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, showcasing insights on practical AI applications.

His consultations have shaped industry practices through work with major clients including **Chipotle, Delta Airlines, Lowes, Tesla, United Healthcare, Walmart**, [Cisco](https://botkit.ai/docs/v4/platforms/webex.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and [Slack](https://slack.com/blog/productivity/botkit-slack-integration-brings-new-level-automation){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

**Beyond technology, Peter organized the renowned [Blip Festival](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/06/arts/music/06blip.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Pulsewave](https://www.brooklynvegan.com/pulsewave-celebrates-10-years-with-big-nyc-show-this-month/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} music series, bridging technical innovation with artistic expression.**

## Human-Centered AI Implementation {#implementation}

Peter is committed to [ethical AI implementation](https://www.itstoilville.com/articles/ai-implementation-ethical-framework){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [human-centered design](https://www.itstoilville.com/articles/human-centered-ai-design){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. He emphasizes that "people greatly overestimate the out-of-the-box quality of what AI is capable of," advocating for thoughtful integration with human escalation paths. **His methodology prioritizes user-centric design and evidence-based decisions, ensuring AI enhances rather than replaces human capabilities.**

While AI systems process information quickly, they lack [moral reasoning and contextual understanding](https://www.itstoilville.com/articles/moral-reasoning-ai-limitations){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Successful implementations keep people as ultimate decision-makers through diverse teams, transparent systems, and [adaptive evaluation frameworks](https://www.itstoilville.com/articles/ai-governance-best-practices){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

## Organizational Transformation {#transformation}

**Today, Peter continues democratizing AI expertise through Toilville's [free office hours](https://www.itstoilville.com/office-hours){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, adapting to evolving technologies while maintaining core principles.** His background uniquely positions him to help organizations leverage AI without sacrificing domain knowledge.

His philosophy that "it's easier for clients to learn some AI than for experts to learn their domain expertise" drives his pragmatic approach to transformation. Through careful integration, Toilville preserves institutional wisdom while introducing new AI capabilities.

This approach, which you can learn more about [by contacting Toilville](https://www.itstoilville.com/contact){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, enables organizations to enhance their competitive edge by combining specialized knowledge with tailored AI solutions.
